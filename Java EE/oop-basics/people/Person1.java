/** The first of several variations of a Person class that
 *  progressively adds more features. The next lecture
 *  will add even more capabilities, most importantly
 *  private instance variables (with accessor methods)
 *  and JavaDoc documentation. These early examples should
 *  <b>not</b> be taken as representative of real-life
 *  coding style!
 *  <p>
 *  From <a href="http://courses.coreservlets.com/Course-Materials/">the
 *  coreservlets.com tutorials on JSF 2, PrimeFaces, Ajax, JavaScript, jQuery, GWT, Android,
 *  Spring, Hibernate, JPA, RESTful Web Services, Hadoop, Spring MVC,
 *  servlets, JSP, Java 8 lambdas and streams (for those that know Java already), 
 *  and Java 8 programming (for those new to Java)</a>.
